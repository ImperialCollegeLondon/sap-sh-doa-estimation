# sap-sh-doa-estimation
Direction of arrival estimation algorithms in the spherical harmonics domain

# Overview
Given the signals from a spherical microphone array, these algorithms will estimate the directions of arrival of the sound sources.

# Dependencies
Requires voicebox which can be downloaded from http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html.

# Instructions
- clone the repository
- in `setup_paths.m` edit `PATH_TO_VOICEBOX`
- run `demo_all.m`
